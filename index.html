                    <figcaption>The graph highlights the persistence of the gender pay gap across various occupations. <b>For every category, male earnings significantly exceed those of females,</b> especially in managerial and machinery operator roles. Even in traditionally <b>female-dominated fields</b> like clerical and administrative work, the <b>disparity remains noticeable</b>. The most substantial gap is evident in managerial positions, where men earn significantly more. This visualization reinforces that gender pay inequality <b>continues to be a prominent issue</b> in the workforce across different sectors.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The gender pay gap across Australian states varies significantly, with <b>Western Australia showing the highest disparity</b>, while <b>Tasmania has the lowest</b>. Northern Territory and Queensland also exhibit significant pay gaps, while South Australia, New South Wales, and Northern Victoria show moderate levels of disparity. Victoria demonstrates a slightly lower but still notable pay gap. Overall, these variations highlight regional differences in gender pay inequality, with some states facing greater challenges in achieving pay equity.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The line chart illustrates earnings over time for both genders across private and public sectors from 2014 to 2024. Throughout this period, there is a consistent <b>upward trend in earnings</b> for all groups, but there is <b>no indication of efforts to close the gender pay gap</b>. Public sector males consistently earn the highest, followed by private sector males, while both female categories remain below their male counterparts with similar gaps over the years. This pattern suggests that while earnings have increased for everyone, the relative differences between genders have remained largely unchanged, reflecting an <b>absence of substantial progress</b> toward gender pay equity.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The scatter plot provides the earnings for various employment categories full-time, part-time, and all workers segmented by gender. Across all categories, <b>full-time males</b> consistently show <b>higher earnings at every level</b> (1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile), indicating significant disparity compared to females. Full-time <b>females</b>, as well as part-time males and females, have <b>consistently lower</b> earnings across these quantiles, with part-time females showing the lowest earnings overall. The comparison highlights a clear earnings gap between genders, not only for full-time workers but also for those working part-time, further emphasizing the <b>persistent inequities.</b></figcaption>
