                    <figcaption>The line chart illustrates earnings over time for both genders across private and public sectors from 2014 to 2024. Throughout this period, there is a consistent upward trend in earnings for all groups, but there is no indication of efforts to close the gender pay gap. Public sector males consistently earn the highest, followed by private sector males, while both female categories remain below their male counterparts with similar gaps over the years. This pattern suggests that while earnings have increased for everyone, the relative differences between genders have remained largely unchanged, reflecting an absence of substantial progress toward gender pay equity.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The scatter plot provides a breakdown of earnings for various employment categories full-time, part-time, and all workers segmented by gender. Across all categories, full-time males consistently show higher earnings at every level (1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile), indicating significant disparity compared to females. Full-time females, as well as part-time males and females, have consistently lower earnings across these quantiles, with part-time females showing the lowest earnings overall. The comparison highlights a clear earnings gap between genders, not only for full-time workers but also for those working part-time, further emphasizing the persistent inequities in compensation based on gender.</figcaption>
